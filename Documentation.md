# Documentation: 20 Harmless but Funny and Creepy Windows Viruses

## Overview
This document describes 20 harmless Halloween prank programs designed to simulate creepy and humorous "virus" effects on Windows systems.
These programs are purely for entertainment, causing no permanent damage or data loss. Some include visual distortions like screen glitches, 
melting effects, or skull imagery for a spooky yet playful vibe. Each entry includes a description, behavior, visual effects (if applicable), 
and a "removal" method to ensure reversibility.

## Technical Notes
- **Implementation**: These pranks would be coded as lightweight scripts (e.g., Python, AutoHotkey) or small executables, using Windows APIs for UI manipulation, sound playback, and visual effects (e.g., DirectX for glitch/melt animations). All effects are temporary, stored in memory, and do not modify system files.
- **Safety**: No data is altered or deleted. All changes are cosmetic and reversible via key combos, hidden files, or rebooting.
- **Visual Effects**: Glitch effects use pixelation/shader techniques; melting effects use warping animations; skull imagery is rendered as semi-transparent overlays.
